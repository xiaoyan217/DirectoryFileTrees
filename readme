For each of the first three faulty BDT implemenations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1        
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2        
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3        
===============================================================

For bdtBad4, you do not have to find the bug. Instead, indicate what
is different about trying to debug this executable in gdb versus the
other three:



For bdtBad5, you do not have to find the bug. Instead, indicate one
hypothesis for how the program could crash within the DynArray module,
which we promise is itself correct:

What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?
